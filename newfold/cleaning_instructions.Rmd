# Meta Data File

Perhaps the most important document.

var_name : nothing special

var_label

brief_desc

var_type: will become important soon enough interval type: must either
be continous or discrete

possible_invalid_codes" : write all of what to check for in a string
separated by commas

invalid_codes : do not touch this the code will fill in

new_page : this is to move the entire variable info over to the next
page; will likely have to change to allow different tables to move

table_break : split the value table at the rows indicated in the string
separated by commas
